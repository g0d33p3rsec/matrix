# MyPDNS Reporter

### Usage
  - Right-click the page or link and you will find a report button.
  - You can include small details(memo) or related links.
  - Read/Write user comments with just one click.

### Build in smart command features

Say you are going to report `www.example.com`.
You put the below text to add-on/CLI/GUI and tried to report.

```
this site is cloudflare infected! same as https://cloudflare.com/blog!!
https://welcome.example.com/blog/about/it.html
https://example.org
https://example.org/
https://example.net/siteinfo/about/example
https://example.net/siteinfo/about/example
https://example.net/siteinfo/about/example
oh my this is long report.
```

The result will be:

```
> Memo
this site is cloudflare infected! same as https://cloudflare.com/blog!!
https://welcome.example.com/blog/about/it.html
https://example.org
https://example.org/
oh my this is long report.

## Relv Ext Sources
- `https://example.net/siteinfo/about/example`
```

And here is a reason:

- `https://cloudflare.com/blog`: This _line_ does not start with HTTP link (`this site is...`), thus ignored.
- `https://welcome.example.com/blog/about/it.html`: It is same basedomain (Same as `example.com` you are reporting), therefore it is not _external_ sources. Ignored.
- `https://example.org` and `/`: This URL has no path. The URL is not pointing at useful webpage, therefore it is ignored (& treated as memo).
- `https://example.net/siteinfo/about/example`: It is hosted on exteral sources (not same base domain)
  - Also duplicated URLs will be merged into one.

# MyPDNS Screenshot Assistant

### Usage
This add-on is for updating those [Bad screenshot Issues](https://0xacab.org/my-privacy-dns/matrix/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=Need%3A%3AScreenshot). Since there are many anti-bot solutions and services, the quality of the screenshot created by bot is degraded by them. Cetralized screenshot services is always bad because the website can block it by script or IP address.

With your help, those issues can get fresh, clean screenshot. All the add-on need is just one Window (and _clean_ internet). So, what will this add-on do?

1. Load 1 `Need::Screenshot` issue.
2. Load the website and take a screenshot.  (automated action of _you open the reported website and click Reporter Sidebar's `Replace Issue Screenshot` command_)
3. Edit the issue to add new information.  (`New Screenshot` _or_ `cannot connet comment` will be added)

You need _Superuser_ permission to use this add-on because this add-on _edit_ original issue.
All you have to do is,

1. Click Cat icon (toolbar)
2. Resize the window (e.g. 800x800)
3. Input your API token (_only for the first time - add-on will remember this_)
4. Click Start
