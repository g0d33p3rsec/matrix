# How to report domains by email

- Simply send an email to `mypdns_report@riseup.net` with understandable comment.
- Subject does not matter (empty is OK)
- One `domain`/`FQDN`/`URL` per line.
  - Other format will be read as comment.


> Good Example

- Those 4 domains will be reported as ~News with a comment "`those are news sites about airplane or aeroplane`"

```
alpha.com
www.beta.net
blog.charlie.com
https://airlines.delta.com/

those are news sites about airplane
or aeroplane
```


> Bad Example

- No comment
  - Unable to detect category
```
alpha.com
www.beta.net
blog.charlie.com
```

- `abc.net.au` will not be reported because of wrong format (not domain, fqdn or URL)
  - The final comment will be "`abc.net.au,news,USA this is news okay?`"
```
xyz.net.au
abc.net.au,news,USA
def.net.au

this is news okay?
```

- The comment does not have the category
  - The entire issue will be created to Support board instead
```
russian.cat
russian.blue

I like Russian Blue. How about you?
```

- You cannot mix categories
  - Only the first category will be considered. In below example, `thepiratebay.org` will be reported as ~News
```
here is some news
alpha.com
www.beta.net
blog.charlie.com

and a torrent
thepiratebay.org
```
