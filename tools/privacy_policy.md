# Privacy policy


**1. What we receive**

  We may receive one of those data from you to process your request.
  The bottom line is **we do not collect** any unnecessary information.

  - a. `GitLab API Token`
  - b. `Specified URL`, `FQDN` or `base domain`
  - c. `Optional user content, such as Comment`
  - d. `Configuration of website`
    - d1. `Committer website -> Settings`
    - d2. `MyPDNS website -> MyPDNS Account (AnonID)`



**2. How we use `1` data**

  We use following data **ONLY** to provide this service and **NEVER share** them with others.

  - `a`:
    - For reading GitLab 's `account status` (banned or not) and its `username`.
      - Other information like your email address is **NEVER** read, shared, or collected.
    - If you do not want to send token, there are ways you can collaborate:
      - "reporter_guest website" and "Reporter add-on" allows you to join as guest.
  - `b`, `c`:
    - To create, update or improve an issue on your behalf
    - To return requested data to you
    - To improve project Matrix
  - `d`:
    - To save your custom configuration so you can use it again later.
      - These websites do not use Cookies at all.


**3. How long do we keep those data**

  Basically, we keep nothing. The bot process your request and that's all.
  Exceptions are:
  - `d`: Your settings. It will be automatically destroyed after X days of using the website. We believe keeping inactive accounts is a bad idea for security and privacy.
    - `d1`: 30 days
    - `d2`: 93 days (or you can delete your account instantly at any time)


**4. Who can I talk to about your server?**
  - This is not my server. Shared server with **zero-log** policy.
