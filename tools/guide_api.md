## About API Token scope

To use this service you need `MyPDNS.org` API Token. This is for preventing
abusive requests.

The API Token requires **`read_user`** permission to read `account status`
(banned or not) and  `username on mypdns.org`. Other information such as
your email address is NEVER be read or collected.

There is another _optional_ permission, `api`. If you enable it the bot
will automatically `add your vote to already existing issue` for
voting-based priority. Also you can `add your comment from add-on directly` without logged in. It is not required although it will help
maintainers to decide their priority.
(The `committer` website will misbehave if you do not have `api` permission)


## API

Just send a URL and it will turn into useful issue!

Clearnet & Tor:

```
curl --http2 -d "k=yourApiTokenHere&cat=news&url=https://nytimes.com/" -X POST https://apiUrlHere
```

Tor:

```
curl -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050 -d "k=yourApiTokenHere&cat=news&url=https://nytimes.com/" -X POST http://apiUrlHere
```

- Change `k` to your personal access token.
  - e.g. `k=byIe_ns-39cWCQ` (_not `k="ab-Cd_E"` nor `k='a_bc-DE'`_)
- Change `url` to the URL such as: `https://porn.com/lesbian.html`

- The response is _always_ JSON.
  - Response _always_ have `reply` key (and `issue` key when the issue is already exist)
  - For example the return value `{'reply':'roger'}` means it accepted your request.
- After some minutes later your issue will appear on Matrix issues (or 
  not, if the issue is already exist or unable to take a screenshot)
  - If there are many submissions this might take hours. You can know 
    your requests are still in line by sending same request again. API
    will reply "`This domain is still waiting in line.`".
- If you are going to report CSAM (aka Child Porn) website add the word 
  `CSAM` to the comment.
  - The issue will be created with Confidential flag.
