New SysJoker Backdoor Targets Windows, Linux, and macOS

> Malware targeting multiple operating systems has become no exception in the malware threat landscape. Vermilion Strike, which was documented just last September, is among the latest examples until now.
>
> In December 2021, we discovered a new multi-platform backdoor that targets Windows, Mac, and Linux. The Linux and Mac versions are fully undetected in VirusTotal. We named this backdoor SysJoker.
>
> SysJoker was first discovered during an active attack on a Linux-based web server of a leading educational institution. After further investigation, we found that SysJoker also has Mach-O and Windows PE versions. Based on Command and Control (C2) domain registration and samples found in VirusTotal, we estimate that the SysJoker attack was initiated during the second half of 2021.
>
> SysJoker masquerades as a system update and generates its C2 by decoding a string retrieved from a text file hosted on Google Drive. During our analysis the C2 changed three times, indicating the attacker is active and monitoring for infected machines. Based on victimology and malwareâ€™s behavior, we assess that SysJoker is after specific targets.
>
> SysJoker was uploaded to VirusTotal with the suffix .ts which is used for TypeScript files. A possible attack vector for this malware is via an infected npm package.
>
> Below we provide a technical analysis of this malware together with IoCs and detection and response mitigations.
